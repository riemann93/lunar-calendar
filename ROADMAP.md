# Roadmap — Lunar Calendar

A living document of planned features, roughly ordered by priority. Updated as the app evolves.

## Foundation (build next)

These make the app functional enough to use daily.

- **Lunar/Gregorian mode toggle** — Switch between the 13-month lunar view and standard 12-month Gregorian view. See your life in both systems. This is the core value prop of the app.
- **Today indicator** — Highlight the current date so you can orient yourself at a glance.
- **Year navigation** — Browse forward/backward through years. Current year shown by default.
- **Navigation between views** — Wire up the "Calendar View" and "Explore & Learn" pill buttons to actually navigate between screens.

## Core features

The features that make the app worth keeping on your phone.

- **Moon phase display** — Show the lunar phase (new, waxing, full, waning) on each date. Use subtle icons or visual indicators that fit the warm aesthetic.
- **Events & notes** — Tap a date to add an event or note. Support multi-day events that span across days.
- **Cycle tracking** — Optional tracking layer for menstrual cycles, sleep, energy, or mood — tied to the lunar phases. Privacy-first, all data stays on-device.
- **Local persistence** — Save events, notes, and preferences to device storage so nothing is lost between sessions.

## Polish & delight

The details that make the app feel intentional and beautiful.

- **Visual refresh** — Refine the color palette, ensure consistent spacing/typography, and add a dark mode option (warm-toned, not blue-black).
- **Animations** — Smooth transitions between months, views, and years. Satisfying micro-interactions on date selection and event creation.
- **Onboarding** — Brief first-launch experience explaining the 13-month concept and how to use the app.

## Explore & Learn section

Content that gives the app depth beyond being "just a calendar."

- **About section** — The story and reasoning behind the app. Space for your own written material.
- **The 13-month calendar explained** — Why 13 months of 28 days? How does it compare to the Gregorian calendar? Interactive visual comparison.
- **Moon phases & meaning** — Educational content about the lunar cycle: what each phase represents, how different cultures have related to it, practical applications (gardening, wellness, intention-setting).

## Future ideas

Longer-term possibilities to explore as the app matures.

- **Gregorian ↔ Lunar date converter** — Type in a regular date and see what it is in the 13-month system (and vice versa).
- **Shareable calendar** — Export events as ICS files for Google Calendar / Apple Calendar, with Sol month dates translated to Gregorian equivalents.
- **Home screen widget** — Glanceable widget showing today's lunar date and moon phase.
- **Notifications & reminders** — Gentle nudges for full moons, new moons, or upcoming events.
- **Community / social layer** — Share your calendar, intentions, or cycle insights with a trusted circle. Very long-term.
